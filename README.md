# Linac Logger Device Cleaner

This project was used to produce a list of valid and unique devices that are being data logged.

## Requirements

ACL is required to get the rates from the data logger lists associated with the devices.

## Workflow

Note: We don't have a method for getting the initial list of devices in the [`./data_logger_device_dump`](./data_logger_device_dump) directory. We should find a way to create these files for posterity.

Running `python3 parse_data_logger_devices.py` uses the files in the [`./data_logger_device_dump`](./data_logger_device_dump) directory to produce [`./output/linac_logger_unique_devices.txt`](./output/linac_logger_unique_devices.txt).

The output from above can be used as a device list with `acl linac_logger_lists.acl > output/linac_logger_rates.txt` to produce [`./output/linac_logger_rates.txt`](./output/linac_logger_rates.txt).

### Duplicate device count

[`./output/linac_logger_duplicate_count.txt`](./output/linac_logger_duplicate_count.txt) was generated by running `sort output/linac_logger_devices.txt | uniq -c | sort > output/linac_logger_duplicate_count.txt` from a unix command line.

## Validating device lists

There's concern that we don't have a comprehensive list of relevant devices given that most sources of devices are human maintained. Here are strategies for determining what devices may be left out.

### Device database machine field

The device database has a machine field that can be Linac. The output files are a list of devices with the machine field Linac, [`./output/machine_linac_devices.txt`](./output/machine_linac_devices.txt). Then there are files for the devices of that list that are logged, [`./output/logged_linac_devices.txt`](./output/logged_linac_devices.txt), and not logged, [`./output/unlogged_linac_devices.txt`](./output/unlogged_linac_devices.txt). These lists are generated by [`./gen_device_lists.acl`](./gen_device_lists.acl).

Note: Queries to the data logger configuration are slow so it takes minutes to run the ACL script.
